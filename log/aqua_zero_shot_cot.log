A: Let's think step by step. 

There are more than 501 students in the school. 
20% of them exactly took physics. 
28% of them exactly took math. 

We can write this as: 

There are more than 501 students in the school. 
There are more than 100 students who took physics. 
There are more than 140 students who took math. 

We want to find the least possible number of students in the school.

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the area of the paper. The paper is in a square form, so the area is just the length of one side squared. The length of one side is 20 cm, so the area is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2. 

Next, we need to calculate the area of the two semi-circles. The area of a semi-circle is half the area of a circle, and the area of a circle is pi * r^2, where r is the radius. The radius of each semi-circle is half the length of one side,

A: Let's think step by step. 

The first thing we need to do is calculate the semi-annual interest rate. We do this by dividing the annual interest rate by the number of compounding periods per year. In this case, we divide 12% by 2 to get 6%. 

Next, we need to calculate the amount of interest that accrues each six months. We do this by multiplying the face value of the bond ($5,000) by the semi-annual interest rate (6%). This gives us $300. 

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of interest that accrues over the life

There are 12 children to the left of Neha, so there must be at least 12 children in the row. 

There are 6 children to the right of Radha, so there must be at least 18 children in the row. 

There are 6 children between Radha and Neha, so there must be at least 24 children in the row.

Q: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's think step by step. 

The cost of new tires is $180 per tire. 
The cost of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire. 

The difference in cost is $180 - $40 = $140. 

To find the percent increase, we take the difference in cost and divide it by the original cost. In other words, we take $140 and divide it by $40. 

$140/$40 = 3.5 

3.5 is greater than 1, so we know that the new tires cost more than the repaired tires. 

To find the percent increase

A: Let's think step by step. 

Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300. 

That means that the 5 articles cost $60 each. 

The price of each article decreased by 15%.

Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
A: Let's think step by step. 

The first car will travel 15 miles in 15/55 hours. 
The second car will travel 15 miles in 15/52 hours. 

Now we need to compare the two times. 

15/55 = 0.2727272727272727 
15/52 = 0.28846153846153846 

Since 0.28846153846153846 is greater than 0.2727272727272727, it will take the second car longer to travel 15 miles. Therefore, the answer is (C).

A: Let's think step by step. 

There are 10 different types of books. 

That means we need at least 10 different codes. 

The codes can be either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. 

That means the maximum number of codes we would need is 20. 

However, we know that each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters. 

That means some of the codes can be single letters, and some of the codes can be pairs of letters.

Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. 
Q is younger than R by x years. 
Q is older than T by x years. 

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for x. 

R + T = 50 
R - Q = x 
T - Q = x 

R + T = 50 
R - T = -x

A: Let's think step by step. 

The first thing we need to do is figure out what the semi-perimeter of the room is. The semi-perimeter is just half of the perimeter, so we need to find the perimeter first. 

The perimeter is just the sum of all the sides of the room. We know that the height is 2/5 of the semi-perimeter, so we can set up the following equation: 

2/5sp = h

Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Let's think step by step. 

C's share is 150,000. 
The total profit is 375,000. 

That means B's share is 375,000 - 150,000 = 225,000. 

Now we know that B's share is 60,000 more than A's share. 

That means A's share is 225,000 - 60,000 = 165,000. 

We also know that the total amount of money invested in the business is 40,000 + 60,000 + 120,000 = 220,000.

The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours. 
That's an average speed of M/4 miles per hour. 

The athlete rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. 
That's an average speed of N/4 miles per hour.

A: Let's think step by step. 

Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. 

We can set up two equations to solve for the amount of money each person has. 

Arjun + Sajal = x 
2(x - 30) = 3(x - 10) 

We can solve for x and then plug that value back into our original equation to solve for the amount of money each person has. 

x = 100 
Arjun + Sajal = 100 
Arjun = 100 - Sajal 

Now we can plug this value of

A: Let's think step by step. 

We know that 27 bottles cost A cents. 
We want to know how much B bottles will cost in dollars. 
We can set up a proportion: 

27 bottles : A cents :: B bottles : x dollars

We can cross multiply to solve for x: 

27x = AB 
x = AB/27 

Since we want the answer in dollars, we will divide AB by 2700: 

x = AB/2700 

Therefore, the answer is (A).

The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. 
We know that a newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. 
We also know that the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week. 

From this information, we can conclude that the hotel spends $4 x 2 = $8 on Sundays and $1 x 1 = $1 the rest of the days of the week.

Q: Car ‘X’ covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours and car ‘Y’ covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hrs. What is the difference in the speed of the two cars? Answer Choices: (A) 42kms/hr (B) 41km/hr (C) 43kms/hr (D) 45kms/hr (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step. 

Car X covers 320 km in 8 hours. 
That means, every hour, car X covers 40 km. 

Car Y covers 415 km in 5 hours. 
That means, every hour, car Y covers 83 km. 

Now, we just need to find the difference in speed. 

83 km - 40 km = 43 km/hr

Therefore, the answer is C.

A: Let's think step by step. 

There are 100 boys in the class. 

We know that 2/5 of the children in the class are girls. 

That means that 2/5 of the total number of children in the class are girls. 

We also know that the total number of children in the class is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls. 

That means that: 

(2/5)(total number of children in the class) = number of girls in the class 

We can solve for the number of girls in the class by plugging in what

Q: The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's think step by step. 

The bill is partly fixed and partly variable. 
The fixed part is Rs.1800. 
The variable part is Rs.2040-1800=Rs.240. 

Now we can set up the equation: 

540 calls * variable rate + fixed rate = 1800 
620 calls * variable rate + fixed rate = 2040 

We can solve for the variable rate: 

variable rate = (2040-1800)/(620-540) 
variable rate = Rs.60 per 100 calls 

Now we can plug in 500 calls and solve for 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the yard. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the shape, so we need to add up all of the sides. 

The yard is rectangular, so it has four sides. Two of the sides are 10 meters (the ones that are not being fenced in), and the other two sides are x meters. So, the perimeter is 2(10) + 2x = 20 + 2x. 

We know that the perimeter is equal to 240, so we can set up the equation: 

20 + 2x = 240
 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D. 

2x = 220
x = 110

The fencing needed is 110 meters.

A: Let's think step by step. 

Since x is negative and y is positive, we know that x < 0 and y > 0. 

Since |x^3| > |y^2|, we know that -x^3 < y^2. 

Now we just need to solve for x and y. 

-x^3 < y^2

-x < y^2/x^3

-x < (y/x)^2

-x < y/x

Now we just need to solve for x and y. 

-x < y

A: Let's think step by step. 

The retailer sold the appliance for 40% above cost. 

That means if the cost was $x, the selling price would be 1.4x. 

We know that the gross profit was $20. So: 

1.4x - x = 20 

0.4x = 20 

x = 20/0.4 

x = $50 

The retailer sold the appliance for $50.

There were a total of 96 friends who were going to attend the picnic. 
4 of them did not turn up, so there were 92 friends who attended the picnic. 
Each person had to contribute Rs.4 extra, so the total amount of money spent on the picnic was Rs.368. 

Now, we just have to solve for x: 

368 = 96x

A: Let's think step by step. 

The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. 
This means that for every 1 kg of oranges, the merchant paid Rs. 5. 
The merchant then sold the oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg. 
For every 1 kg of oranges sold, the merchant made Rs. 2.50. 

To calculate the percentage gain, we need to find out how much profit the merchant made on the whole sale. 

The merchant made a profit of Rs. 2.50 for every kg of oranges sold.

First, we need to calculate how long it took Winson to run to school. We know that he ran at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, so we can calculate that he ran for 0.6 hours. 

Next, we need to calculate how long it took Winson to walk home from school. We know that he walked at an average speed of 5 miles/hr, so we can calculate that he walked for 0.4 hours. 

Now, we need to add up the two times to get the total time for the journey. 0.6 hours + 0.4 hours

Q: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
A: Let's think step by step. 

We know that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000. 
That means that one number is bigger than the other number by 256000. 
We also know that the sum of the numbers is 1000. 
That means that the two numbers have a sum of 1000. 

Now we can solve for the two numbers. 

Let's call the two numbers x and y. 

x^2 - y^2 = 256000 
x + y = 1000

We can solve this using the quadratic equation. 

x = (1000 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

A: Let's think step by step. 

There are 5 points on the pentagon, so we need to choose 4 of them. This can be done in 5C4 ways. 

Now, we need to find the number of ways in which these 4 points can be arranged to form a quadrilateral. 

There are 4! ways to arrange 4 points. 

However, we need to be careful because some of these arrangements will result in the same quadrilateral. For example, the quadrilateral ABCD is the same as the quadrilateral BCDA. 

To account for this, we need to divide

How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Let's think step by step. 

There are 8 people on the team, so we need to choose 4 people. 
There are ${8 \choose 4} = 70$ ways to do this. 

However, we need to exclude the cases where the group is all men or all women. 

There are ${4 \choose 4} = 1$ ways to choose all 4 men. 
There are ${4 \choose 4} = 1$ ways to choose all 4 women.

A: Let's think step by step. 

120 is reduced to 96. 

That means that we took away some amount from 120 to get 96. 

To find the reduction percent, we need to find what percent 96 is of 120. 

We can do this by finding the decimal equivalent of 96% and 120%. 

96% = 96/100 = 0.96

120% = 120/100 = 1.2

0.96 is 80% of 1.2.

This means that the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 6(4/3x), and the total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8x. 

Now we have two equations and two unknowns

Q: A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate? Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
A: Let's think step by step. 

The man borrows Rs.360. 

If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, that means that each month he pays 1/12 of the total amount borrowed, plus interest. 

We can set up an equation to solve for the interest rate: 

360 = 12 * 31.50 
- 360 = -12 * 31.50 
360/12 = 31.50 
30 = 31.50 

The interest rate is 1%.

A: Let's think step by step. 

The man spends Rs. 3500 per month. 
This means that his monthly income is greater than Rs. 3500. 
We are told that the man saves 12 1/2% of his income. 
This means that the man's monthly income is 100% - 12.5% = 87.5% of his monthly income. 

We can set up the equation: 

87.5% of monthly income = Rs. 3500 

We can solve for the monthly income: 

Monthly income = Rs. 3500 / 87.5%

A: Let's think step by step. 

There are 700 coins in total. 
There are an equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and 1 rupee coins. 
That means that each type of coin occurs an integer number of times. 
We can write this as: 

25x + 50y + 100z = 700 
where x, y, and z are integers. 

We also know that there are an equal number of each type of coin, so: 

x = y = z 

That means that each type of coin occurs 200 times.

A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we need to find the range of n. 
We know that 36≤n≤72, so n can be any number between 36 and 72, including 36 and 72. 
Now, we need to find the range of x. 
We know that x=(n^2+2√n(n+4)+16)/(n+4√n+4). 
We can plug in different values of n to see what the range of x is. 
For n=36, we get x=12.

A: Let's think step by step. 
First, let's calculate P(A and B). We know that P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) because A and B are independent events. So P(A and B) = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16. 
Now, let's calculate P(A/B). We know that P(A/B) = P(A and B) / P(B). So P(A/B) = 0.16 / 0.8 = 0.2. 
Therefore, the answer is (A).

A: Let's think step by step. 

We know that one of the roots is 1.5. This means that when we plug 1.5 in for x, we should get 0 on the other side. 

So: 

1.5^2 + m(1.5) + 22 = 0 

2.25 + 1.5m + 22 = 0

A: Let's think step by step. 

The grocer makes a 25% profit on each bag of flour sold. 

That means that for every $1 the grocer makes in profit, he sells $4 worth of flour. 

We know that the grocer made $3,000 in profit, so he must have sold $12,000 worth of flour. 

Now we just need to divide $12,000 by the selling price of the flour, $100, to find out how many bags he sold. 

$12,000/$100 = 120 bags

The grocer sold 120 bags of flour.

First, we need to find out what 30% of the original price is: 

Original price x 30% = New price 

$100 x 30% = $30 

This means that the new price is $30 less than the original price. 

Now we need to find out what percentage of the original price is $30: 

$30/$100 = 0.3

A: Let's think step by step. 

The trader sold the article for Rs.360. 
This means that the trader's selling price (SP) was Rs.360. 
The trader made a profit of 20%. 
This means that the trader's profit (P) was 20% of Rs.360, or Rs.72. 

Now we can set up the following equation: 

SP - P = CP 

360 - 72 = CP 

288 = CP

Q: If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
I. Q is the square of a prime number.
II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only
A: Let's think step by step. 

Q is a positive integer, so it's either 1 or greater. 

Q has 5 factors, so it's either 1, 5, 25, 125, or 625. 

Q cannot be 1, because 1 has an infinite number of factors. 

Q cannot be 5, because 5 is a prime number. 

Q cannot be 25, because 25 is the square of a prime number. 

Q cannot be 125, because 125 is the cube of a prime number. 

Q cannot be 625, because 625 is the fifth power of a prime number.

Q: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
A: Let's think step by step. 

Joe's father's age is x. 
Joe's age is y. 
Joe's sister's age is z. 

According to the first sentence, we have: 

x + y + z = 100 

According to the second sentence, we have: 

y = x 

and 

2z = z + z 

or 

z = 2z 

which means that 

z = 0 

which is a contradiction. 

Therefore, the answer is E.

Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
A: Let's think step by step. 

The common difference is 3 months, so each person is 3 months older than the last. 
The youngest person is 7 years old, so the next person is 7 + 3 = 10, and the next is 10 + 3 = 13, and so on. 

Now, we just need to figure out how many people there are. We can do this by setting up an equation. 

7 + (7 + 3) + (10 + 3) + ... + x = 250 

We can simplify this by factoring out the 3.

Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we need to find how long it takes for each ball to make one rotation. 
For ball A, it takes 26 minutes to make 2 full rotations. This means that it takes 13 minutes to make 1 full rotation. 
For ball B, it takes 35 minutes to make 5 full rotations. This means that it takes 7 minutes to make 1 full rotation. 
Now that we know how long it takes for each ball to make one rotation, we can set up a proportion to solve for x, which is the amount of time it will take for both balls to be at the same starting point

A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. 
How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? 

$1000 is his salary, so we want to find how many sales of $250 he must make in order to earn $1000. 

$1000/$250 = 4 

The sales person must make 4 sales of $250 to earn a salary of $1000.

The man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs. This means he walks 30 km in 6 hrs. 
The man walks at 4 kmph for 12 hrs. This means he walks 48 km in 12 hrs. 

Now we need to find the average speed. To do this, we add up the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time traveled. 

30 km + 48 km = 78 km 
6 hrs + 12 hrs = 18 hrs 

78 km ÷ 18 hrs = 4.3 km/h

A: Let's think step by step. 

The first thing we need to do is figure out how long it will take for the two ants to meet. We can do this by finding how long it will take each ant to travel 75 cm. 

Ant A will travel 75 cm in 8.3 hours (75 cm/9 cm per hour = 8.3 hours)

Ant B will travel 75 cm in 12.5 hours (75 cm/6 cm per hour = 12.5 hours)

Since it will take Ant A less time to travel 75 cm, we know that the two ants will meet after 8.3 hours.

Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step. 

The company produces 7200 pens. 
10% of those pens are defective, so 720 pens are rejected. 
That leaves 6480 pens. 
The company sells those pens to the wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. 
The company's profit on those pens is 25%. 

Now we can set up an equation. 

6480(10) = x(.25)

x = Rs. 25920

Now we need to find the cost of each pen. 

Rs. 25920 = 6480(c)

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's think step by step. 

The organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh. 
Each employee contributes an equal amount. 
If each employee contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would be Rs. 6.24 lakh. 

We can set up the equation like this: 

6 lakh = x(employee contribution) 
6.24 lakh = x + 60 

Now we can solve for x: 

6 lakh = x 
6.24 lakh = x + 60 
6.24 lakh - 60 = x + 60 - 60 
6.24 lakh - 60

Alex makes one toy in 7 hours. 
Jacob makes one toy in 9 hours. 

In one hour, Alex makes 1/7 of a toy and Jacob makes 1/9 of a toy. 

In 35 hours, Alex makes 35/7 = 5 toys. 
In 35 hours, Jacob makes 35/9 = 3 and 2/9 toys. 

3 and 2/9 is the same as 32/9, which is 3 and 2/9, which is 3.22.

We know that the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 cm when it is folded along one set of sides, and 66 cm when it is folded along the other set of sides. 

We also know that the perimeter of a rectangle is equal to 2 * (length + width). 

So, if we let L be the length of the rectangle and W be the width of the rectangle, we have the following two equations: 

48 = 2 * (L + W)
66 = 2 * (L + W)

From these two equations, we can solve for L and W.

Q: Five dozen toys are packed in a box and 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round ? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) 8
A: Let's think step by step. 

There are 5 dozen toys in 1 box. 
There are 98 boxes in 1 tempo. 

We need to find out how many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round. 

We can use the following equation: 

(5 dozen toys) x (98 boxes) = (29400 toys) 

We can solve for x: 

(5 dozen toys) x (98 boxes) = (29400 toys) 
5 x 98 = 29400 
490 = 29400 
x = 29400/490 
x = 60  
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

Q: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's think step by step. 
The point is on the edge of the fan blade, so it's 10 cm from the center. 
The fan is rotating in a plane, so it's a 2D rotation. 
The point is rotating at 300 rpm, so it's going to travel 300 * 2pi * 10 cm in 30 seconds. 
The answer is therefore (D).

Q: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to find the percentage of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year. We know that 20 out of 500 deer had tags from the previous year, so the percentage is 20/500, or 4%. 

Now, we need to find the total deer population in the Forest. We can use the information we have to set up a proportion: 

4% = 20/x

We can solve for x by cross-multiplying: 

4x = 20 * 500

x = 5000

Therefore, the total deer population in the Forest

A: Let's think step by step. 

Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back. 
That means that if we take 5 years away from Rahim's current age, Rahim would be 3 times as old as Raj. 
We can set up an equation and solve for Rahim's current age: 

3(Raj's age 5 years ago) = Rahim's age - 5

3(12) = Rahim's age - 5 

Rahim's age = 41

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we know that the length of line segment ST is 22. 

Next, we know that U is the midpoint of line segment ST. This means that the length of line segment SU must be 11. 

Now, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the length of line segment RU. 

We know that the length of line segment RS is 5, so we can plug that in for a. 

We also know that the length of line segment SU is 11, so we can plug that in for b.

A: Let's think step by step. 

A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. 

We can write this as: 

Length = 4 * Breadth + 1 

Now, we know that the perimeter of any rectangle is equal to 2 * (Length + Breadth). 

Therefore, the perimeter of the piece is equal to: 

2 * (4 * Breadth + 1 + Breadth) = 2 * (5 * Breadth + 1) = 10 * Breadth + 2

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's think step by step. 

The average wage for the first 7 days is $87. 
The average wage for the last 7 days is $92. 

We know that the average wage for the entire fortnight is $90. 

We also know that there are a total of 15 days in the fortnight.

A: Let's think step by step. 

Ajay's present age - 6 = present age of Rahul

Divide that number by 18 and we get the present age of Rahul: 

(Ajay's present age - 6)/18 = present age of Rahul

Now we know that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, so: 

Denis's present age = present age of Rahul + 2

We can plug that into our original equation: 

(Ajay's present age - 6)/18 = present age of Rahul + 2

Now we solve for Ajay's present age:

A: Let's think step by step. 

2/3 of a number is 2/3x. 

10 is subtracted from 2/3x, so 2/3x - 10. 

The result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. So 2/3x - 10 = 40 + 1/3x. 

We can solve this equation for x. 

2/3x - 10 = 40 + 1/3x

Multiply both sides by 3: 

6/3x - 30 = 120 + x

Add 30 to both sides

A: Let's think step by step. 

The first thing we need to do is calculate the volume of the tank. The volume of the tank is 8m x 6m x 2.5m. 

8m x 6m x 2.5m = 120m^3

Now that we have the volume of the tank, we need to convert it to litres. 

1m^3 = 1000 litres

120m^3 = 120,000 litres

The capacity of the tank is 120,000 litres.
