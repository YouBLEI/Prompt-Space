Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. 
That means she has a total of 16 pieces of candy. 
If she only ate 8 pieces a day, she would have to divide her candy into two days. 
That means she would have 8 pieces of candy for Day 1 and 8 pieces of candy for Day 2.

Q: Paige and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 4 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Let's think step by step. 
We know that for every 4 pounds they recycled, they earned 1 point. 
We also know that Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds. 
We want to find out how many points they earned in total. 
We can divide 14 by 4 to see how many points Paige would earn for recycling her 14 pounds of paper- she would earn 3.5 points. 
We can also divide 2 by 4 to see how many points her friends would earn for recycling their 2 pounds of paper- they would earn 0.5 points.

A: Let's think step by step. 

Amy made 15 cupcakes and 48 cookies. 
She sold some pastries, so we'll say that she sold x pastries. 
That means that she has 15 - x cupcakes and 48 - x cookies left. 
We know that she has 12 pastries left in total, so that means that 
15 - x + 48 - x = 12

We can solve this equation to find out how many pastries Amy sold. 

15 - x + 48 - x = 12
15 + 48 = 12 + 2x
63 = 12 + 2x
63 - 12

There are 31 new players and 4 returning players. 
That means there are a total of 35 players. 
We want to put them into groups with 7 players in each group. 
That means we need to divide 35 by 7. 
35 divided by 7 equals 5 with no remainder. 
That means there are 5 groups. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

A: Let's think step by step. 
Nancy had 80 files. 
She deleted 31 of them. 
That means she has 80-31=49 files left. 
Since she wants 7 files in each folder, she will need to put them into 7 folders.

Q: Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Edward started with 35 games. 
He sold 19 games. 
That means he has 35 - 19 = 16 games left. 
Each box can hold 8 games. 
That means he will need 16 / 8 = 2 boxes to hold all of his games. 

Therefore, Edward will need 2 boxes to hold all of his games.

A: Let's think step by step. 

Vanessa picked 17 carrots. So we know that there are at least 17 good carrots. 
We also know that Vanessa's mom picked 14 carrots. So we know that there are at least 14 good carrots. 
We know that there are a total of 24 good carrots. 

We can set up an equation to solve this problem. 

17 + 14 = 24 

We know that the total number of good carrots is 24. So we can say that the total number of carrots is the sum of the good carrots and the bad carrots.

A: Let's think step by step. 

The school cafeteria ordered 37 red apples and 45 green apples for students lunches.

We know that the total number of apples is 37 + 45 = 82. 

But, if only 51 students wanted fruit, 

We know that the total number of apples that were wanted is 51. 

how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?

We can find the number of extra apples by subtracting the total number of apples that were wanted from the total number of apples that were ordered. 

This gives us 82 - 51 = 31 extra apples.

Q: For a birthday party Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 9 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Jerry buys 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. 
We need to figure out how many shelves he would fill up. 
The fridge can hold 9 on each shelf. 

We need to divide 41 by 9 and 22 by 9. 
41 divided by 9 is 4 with a remainder of 5. 
22 divided by 9 is 2 with a remainder of 4. 

This means that he would fill up 4 shelves with regular sodas and 2 shelves with diet sodas. 
Therefore, he would fill up a total of 6 shelves. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Q: Roger earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 14 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn?
A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to calculate how much money Roger would have earned if he had mowed all 14 lawns. We can do this by multiplying 9 by 14. 

9 * 14 = 126

Next, we need to calculate how much money Roger would have earned if he had only mowed 6 lawns. We can do this by multiplying 9 by 6. 

9 * 6 = 54

Finally, we need to subtract the amount of money Roger would have earned if he had only mowed 6 lawns from the amount of money Roger would have earned if he had mowed all 14

A: Let's think step by step. 

Henry earned 5 dollars for each lawn he mowed. 

This is telling us that the amount of money Henry earned is proportional to the number of lawns he mowed. In other words, if he mowed more lawns, he would earn more money, and if he mowed fewer lawns, he would earn less money. 

If he had 12 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 7 of them,

This is telling us that Henry was supposed to mow 12 lawns, but he only mowed 5 of them.

A: Let's think step by step. 

Each chocolate bar in a box costs $3. 
If a box had 9 bars total, then Wendy sold all but 3 bars. 
How much money would she have made?

We can solve this problem using algebra. 

Let's start by creating a variable to represent the number of chocolate bars Wendy sold. We'll call this variable "x". 

If Wendy sold "x" chocolate bars, then she would have 9 - x chocolate bars left in the box. 

We know that each chocolate bar costs $3, so the total cost of the chocolate bars Wendy sold

Q: Katie uploaded 30 pictures from her phone and 51 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 9 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums?
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we'll add up the total number of pictures that Katie uploaded: 30 + 51 = 81. 
Since Katie wants to put the same number of pictures in each album, we'll divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums she wants to create: 81 ÷ 9 = 9. 
That means each album would have 9 pictures in it. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Q: Vanessa and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Vanessa picked 17 and her mother picked 14. If only 24 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Vanessa picked 17 carrots. So we know that there are at least 17 good carrots. 
We also know that Vanessa's mom picked 14 carrots. So we know that there are at least 14 good carrots. 
We know that there are a total of 24 good carrots. 

We can set up an equation to solve this problem. 

17 + 14 = 24
