Jada flips the coin.
Sarita does not flip the coin.
Allen flips the coin.

So, the coin is heads up, Pretty flips it, so it's tails up, Jada flips it, so it's heads up again, Sarita doesn't flip it, so it stays heads up, and then Allen flips it, so it's tails up. 
Therefore, the answer (Yes or No) is No.
