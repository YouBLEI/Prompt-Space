Gwen's mom gave her 8 dollars. 
Gwen's dad gave her 5 more dollars. 
That means that Gwen's dad gave her a total of 5 + 8 = 13 dollars. 
Gwen spent 4 dollars. 
That means that Gwen has 8 + 5 - 4 = 9 dollars left. 

We can see that Gwen's mom gave her 8 dollars and Gwen's dad gave her 13 dollars. So Gwen's mom gave her 8 - 13 = -5 dollars less than Gwen's dad.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 71 bottle caps and 24 wrappers at the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 16 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers does danny have now?
A: Let's think step by step. 
Danny has 71 bottle caps and 24 wrappers at the park. 
He brings 28 bottle caps and 16 wrappers home. 
That means he has 71 - 28 = 43 bottle caps and 24 - 16 = 8 wrappers at the park. 
Now he has 28 + 43 = 71 bottle caps and 16 + 8 = 24 wrappers at home. 
So he has 71 - 24 = 47 more bottle caps than wrappers. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 47.

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 210 dollars off each jersey and $ 240 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?
A: Let's think step by step. 

The Razorback shop makes $210 off each jersey and $240 off each t-shirt. 
During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. 
How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?

To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much money the shop made from selling t-shirts and how much money the shop made from selling jerseys. 

The shop made $210 x 23 = $4730 from selling jerseys. 
The shop made $240 x 177 = $42,480 from selling t-shirts. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $42,480 - $4730 = $37,750. 
The shop made $37,750 more from selling t-shirts than jerseys.

Q: Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework How many pages of reading homework did she have to complete?
A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we know that Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework. 

Second, we know that she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework. 

That means that if we start with the 7 pages of math homework, and then subtract 4 pages, we will be left with the number of pages of reading homework that she had to complete. 

7 pages of math homework - 4 pages = 3 pages of reading homework

Q: Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day How many days would the soda bottles last?
A: Let's think step by step. 
We know that Debby drinks 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day. 
We also know that she bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles. 
That means that she has 360 - 9 = 351 soda bottles left. 
We want to know how many days the soda bottles will last, so we need to divide 351 by 9. 
351 / 9 = 39. 
That means that the soda bottles will last for 39 days. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is thirty-nine.

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 115 dollars off each jersey and $ 25 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?
A: Let's think step by step. 

The shop makes $115 off each jersey and $25 off each t-shirt. 
During the Arkansas and Texas tech game, they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys. 
How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?

We can set up an equation to solve this problem. 

$115x + $25y = Total amount of money made

x = number of jerseys sold
y = number of t-shirts sold

We know that 113 t-shirts were sold and 78 jerseys were sold. 

$115(78) + $

Q: Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?
A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the area of one room. 
To do this, we need to multiply the length and width of the room. 
The length is 19 feet and the width is 18 feet. 
19 multiplied by 18 equals 342. 
This means that one room has an area of 342 square feet. 

Now we need to calculate the area of all 20 rooms. 
To do this, we need to multiply the area of one room by 20.

Q: Baker made 54 cakes and 143 pastries. If he sold 68 cakes and 92 pastries How many more pastries than cakes did baker sell?
A: Let's think step by step. 

There are 54 cakes and 143 pastries.

Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 41 sacks of unripe oranges and 86 sacks of ripe oranges per day. How many more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe oranges are harvested per day?
A: Let's think step by step. 

We are looking for the difference in sacks of ripe and unripe oranges. 
We know that 41 sacks of unripe oranges are harvested per day. 
We know that 86 sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day. 

To find the difference, we need to subtract the number of unripe oranges from the number of ripe oranges. 

86 - 41 = 45 

45 more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day than unripe oranges. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45.

6 of those bottle caps were thrown away. 
That means that 54 bottle caps remain in his collection. 

We're trying to find out how many more bottle caps Danny found than those he threw away. So, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny found in total. 

We know that Danny has 54 bottle caps in his collection. We also know that he found 50 new bottle caps. 

If we add those two numbers together, we get 54 + 50 = 104. 

That means that Danny found 104 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 104.

Q: Jerry had 7 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added some more action figures to the shelf and removed 10 of the old ones. If there are 8 action figures on his shelf now How many action figures did he add to the shelf?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Jerry had 7 action figures on a shelf in his room. 

That's our starting point. We're told that he added some more action figures to the shelf and removed 10 of the old ones. 

That means that there are now 18 action figures in total on the shelf. 

We're told that there are 8 action figures on his shelf now. 

That means that 10 action figures were removed. 

So if 10 were removed and there are 18 in total, that means that 8 were added.

Q: Adam could fit 11 action figures on each shelf in his room. His room has 4 shelves and 40 cabinets. How many total action figures could his shelves hold?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Adam could fit 11 action figures on each shelf in his room.

That means that each shelf could hold a maximum of 44 action figures (4 shelves x 11 action figures).

However, his room also has 40 cabinets.

We need to take into account the cabinets as well, which would reduce the number of action figures that could fit on the shelves. If each cabinet can hold 2 action figures, that means that the cabinets could hold a maximum of 80 action figures (40 cabinets x 2 action figures).

Therefore, the total number of action figures that his shelves could hold would be 44 + 80

A: Let's think step by step. 

Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. 

That means that if we start with Doug's number of marbles, then add 2, we'll get Ed's number of marbles. So: 

Doug's number of marbles + 2 = Ed's number of marbles

Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. 

That means that Doug's current number of marbles is less than it was before. So: 

Doug's current number of marbles < Doug's number of marbles + 2

Now Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug

Ed's number of marbles - Doug's number of marbles = 19

Q: Baker made 14 cakes and 153 pastries. If he sold 8 pastries and 97 cakes How many more cakes than pastries did baker sell?
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we need to figure out how many pastries the baker has left. We know that the baker started with 153 pastries, and he sold 8 pastries. So the baker has 153 - 8 = 145 pastries left. 
Now, we need to figure out how many cakes the baker has left. We know that the baker started with 14 cakes, and he sold 97 cakes. So the baker has 14 - 97 = -83 cakes left. 
Finally, we need to figure out how many more cakes than pastries the baker sold. We know that the baker sold 97 cakes and 8 pastries. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 97 - 8 = 89. The baker sold 89 more cakes than pastries.

Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday.

We don't know how many crayons were in the box originally, so we'll call that number x.

During the school year he gave 52 crayons to his friends while he lost 535 crayons.

A: Let's think step by step. 

The first thing we need to do is figure out how many sacks of oranges are harvested in total. We can do this by adding 44 and 25 together. 

44 + 25 = 69

So, 69 sacks of oranges are harvested in total each day. 

Next, we need to figure out how many more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested than unripe oranges. We can do this by subtracting 25 from 44.

That means that before she picked any apples, there were 3 ripe apples and some number of unripe apples on the tree. 
Now the tree has 2 ripe apples and 27 unripe apples. 
That means that in total, the tree had 2 + 3 = 5 ripe apples and 27 + some number = some number unripe apples.

Q: Jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room. If her room is 2 feet wide What is the length of her room?
A: Let's think step by step. 

We know that the area of a square is length * width, so we can set that equation equal to 10. 

We also know that the width of the room is 2 feet. 

So we have: 

2 * length = 10 

We can solve for length by dividing both sides by 2. 

length = 10/2 

length = 5 

So the length of the room is 5 feet. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 5

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to calculate how much she weighed after the first week of jogging. 

We know that she weighed 92 kilograms at the start, and that she lost 56 kilograms in the first week. This means that, after the first week, she weighed 92 - 56 = 36 kilograms. 

Now, we need to calculate how much she weighed after the second week of jogging. 

We know that she weighed 36 kilograms after the first week, and that she lost 99 kilograms in the second week. This means that, after the second week, she weighed 36 - 99 = -63

Q: Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree. Thereafter 2 new apples grew on the tree. Now the tree has 6 apples still on it. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree. 

That means there were 7 apples to begin with. 

2 new apples grew on the tree. 

That means there were 9 apples on the tree at some point. 

Now the tree has 6 apples still on it. 

That means there are 3 apples missing from the tree. 

7 - 3 = 4

So the tree had 4 apples to begin with.

Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?
A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pages are in each chapter. We can do this by dividing 193 by 15, which equals 12.9333. We'll round this up to 13 pages per chapter. 

Next, we need to find out how many days it would take to read 13 pages. We can do this by dividing 660 by 13, which equals 50.769. We'll round this down to 50 days. 

Finally, we need to find out how many chapters Frank read per day. We can do this by dividing 15 by 50, which equals 0.3.

Q: 15 campers went rowing in the morning. Some more campers went rowing in the afternoon. If a total of 32 campers went rowing that day How many campers went rowing in the afternoon?
A: Let's think step by step. 

There were 15 campers rowing in the morning. 
Then, some more campers went rowing in the afternoon, so the total number of campers rowing that day is 32. 
If we know that the total number of campers rowing that day is 32, and we know that 15 campers were rowing in the morning, then we can figure out how many campers went rowing in the afternoon. 

32 - 15 = 17 

17 campers went rowing in the afternoon. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 17

A: Let's think step by step. 
294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. 
47 pickers fill 47 drums of raspberries per day. 
So 1 picker fills 5.1 drums of grapes per day and 1 picker fills 1 drum of raspberries per day. 
Now we need to find out how many pickers are needed to fill 146 drums of grapes in 146 days. 
We can set up a proportion:

Q: Matthew had 24 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left How many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Matthew had 24 crackers. 
If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends, that would mean he gave 8 crackers to each friend. 
That would leave Matthew with 0 crackers. 

That can't be right, so Matthew gave 7 crackers to each friend.

A: Let's think step by step. 
There are 8 different books in the series. You read 19 of them. 
That means you still have 8 - 19 = -11 books left to read. 
There are 10 different movies in the series. You watched 61 of them.

The first chapter is 35 pages long. 
The second chapter is 18 pages long. 
The third chapter is 3 pages long. 

To find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the third chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter. 

18 - 3 = 15 

The second chapter has 15 more pages than the third chapter. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 15.

Q: Frank was reading through some books. Each book had 66 pages and it took Frank 12 days to finish each book. If he takes 492 days to finish all books How many books did he read?
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we need to find out how many pages are in all the books. We know that each book has 66 pages, so we can multiply 66 by the number of books. 
66 * x = 492
66x = 492
x = 492/66
x = 7.45
Since we can't have a fraction of a book, we'll round down to 7 books. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

John needs 11 nails in all. 
Each plank needs 3 nails. 
8 additional nails were used. 

We can set up the equation like this: 

3x + 8 = 11

We want to solve for x, which is the number of planks. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides: 

3x + 8 - 8 = 11 - 8
3x = 3

Now we can divide both sides by 3: 

3x/3 = 3/3
x = 1

John needs 1 plank for the

A: Let's think step by step. 

There are 15 aquariums for saltwater animals. 
Each aquarium has 19 animals in it. 
That means there are 15 * 19 = 285 animals in the saltwater aquariums. 

There are 62 aquariums for freshwater animals. 
Each aquarium has 19 animals in it. 
That means there are 62 * 19 = 1178 animals in the freshwater aquariums.

A: Let's think step by step. 

Paul had 51 books and 106 pens. 
He sold some books and pens in a garage sale. 
He had 82 books and 14 pens left.

So we can say that

157 - 82 - 14 = 

We don't know how many he sold, so we'll put in a variable, x. 

51 + 106 = 157

Q: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 266 of the pickers that they fill 90 drums of grapes in 5 days. How many drums of grapes would be filled in each day?
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we need to figure out how many grapes are in each drum. We know that 90 drums are filled in 5 days, so that means that 18 drums are filled in each day. 
We also know that 266 pickers are filling these drums, so that means that each picker is filling $\frac{18}{266}$ drums each day. 
Now, we need to figure out how many grapes are in each drum. We know that 266 pickers are filling 90 drums in 5 days. That means that each picker is filling $\frac{90}{266}$ drums in 5 days.  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 
$$\frac{18}{266}*\frac{90}{266}=\frac{1}{3}$$

He found some more bottle caps at the park. 

We want to know how many bottle caps he found at the park. 

We can set up an equation to solve this problem.

That means that the mailman has to give a total of 32 * 55 = 1760 pieces of junk mail. 
If he gives 8 mails to each house in a block, that means that he has to give a total of 8 * x = 1760 pieces of junk mail, where x is the number of houses in a block.

If they are travelling at speed of 17, that means they will need 17/369 hours to finish the journey. 
Now we just need to convert 17/369 hours into minutes. 
17/369 hours is the same as 17/(369/60) minutes, which is the same as 17/6.15 minutes.

If he picked 53 tomatoes, he would have 177-53=124 tomatoes left. 

We don't know how many potatoes he has left, but we can find out. 

The total number of vegetables is 177+12=189. 

If the farmer picked 53 vegetables, then 189-53=136 vegetables would be left. 

We know that 124 of those 136 vegetables are tomatoes, so the remaining vegetables must be potatoes. 

Therefore, the farmer would have 136-124=12 potatoes

Q: A book has 3 chapters. The first chapter is 91 pages long the second chapter is 23 pages long and the third chapter is 25 pages long. How many more pages does the first chapter have than the second chapter?
A: Let's think step by step. 

The first chapter has 91 pages. 
The second chapter has 23 pages. 

To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. This can be written as: 

91 - 23 = 

68. 

Therefore, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 68.

Q: Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches in gym class today. David did 19 more push-ups but 27 less crunches than zachary. How many push-ups did David do?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches. 
David did more push-ups than Zachary, so we can say that David did at least 60 push-ups. 
David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so we can say that David did at most 17 crunches. 

Now we have a range for the number of push-ups and crunches that David did. He did between 60 and 17 push-ups, and between 17 and 44 crunches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 60.

Q: Robin has some packages of gum. There are 7 pieces in each package. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. In all the number of pieces of gums robin has is 41. How many packages does Robin have?
A: Let's think step by step. 

We know that there are 7 pieces of gum in each package. 
We also know that Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. 
We want to know how many packages Robin has. 

We can start by adding the number of pieces of gum in each package to the number of extra pieces of gum. 

7 + 6 = 13

We know that the total number of pieces of gum is 41. 

41 - 13 = 28

We can divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces in each package to find out how many packages Robin has.
