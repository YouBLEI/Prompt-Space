Q: A spaceship traveled 0.5 of a light-year from Earth to Planet X and 0.1 of a light-year from Planet X to Planet Y. Then it traveled 0.1 of a light-year from Planet Y back to Earth. How many light-years did the spaceship travel in all?
A: Let's think step by step. The spaceship traveled 0.5 light-years from Earth to Planet X. Then it traveled 0.1 light-years from Planet X to Planet Y. Finally, it traveled 0.1 light-years from Planet Y back to Earth. So the total distance the spaceship traveled is 0.5 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.7 light-years.

A: Let's think step by step. 

Michelle started with 0.5 of a tank of gas. 
When she made it back to the pizzeria, she had used up some of her gas, so she had less than 0.5 of a tank left. 
The amount of gas left can be represented as 0.5 - x, where x is the amount of gas used. 
We know that x is equal to 0.16666666666666666, so we can plug that in for x.

A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we need to convert everything to the same units. In this case, we can convert everything to miles. 
19.833333333333332 miles = 19.833333333333332 * 1 miles = 19.833333333333332 miles
9.166666666666666 miles = 9.166666666666666 * 1 miles = 9.166666666666666 miles
Now that we have the same units, we can compare how much farther Wendy ran than walked. 
19.833333333333332 miles - 9.166666666666666 miles = 10.666666666666664 miles

Q: Trenton sells electronic supplies. Each week he earns 190 dollars plus commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. This week his goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. How much sales  he must make to reach his goal?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Trenton's goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. 
This means that his total earnings for the week must be at least 500 dollars. 
We know that his total earnings are 190 dollars plus commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. 
We want to find out how much sales he must make in order to reach his goal. 

We can set up the equation like this: 

500 = 190 + 0.04s 

We can solve for s by subtracting 190 from both sides: 

500 - 190 = 0.04s - 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 

500 - 190 = 0.04s

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the world grain demand. 

We know that the world grain supply is 1800000 metric tons. 

We also know that the supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand. 

This means that the world grain demand will be 1800000 / 0.75 = 2400000 metric tons.

Sara spent $10.62 on 2 tickets to a movie theater. 
Sara spent $1.59 on renting a movie. 
Sara spent $13.95 on buying a movie. 

To find the total amount of money Sara spent on movies, we need to add up all 3 of those numbers.

Q: Brenda, Betty’s sister, wanted to have 3 bracelets with star-shaped stones. She also bought 36 star-shaped stones from the local store and gave it to Betty. How many star-shaped stones will there be in each of the bracelet Betty makes for Brenda?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Brenda wants 3 bracelets. 
Each bracelet has an unknown, but equal, number of star-shaped stones. 
Betty has 36 star-shaped stones. 

We can set up an equation to solve this problem. 

3x = 36

Since Brenda wants 3 bracelets, we want to know how many star-shaped stones are in each bracelet. We can solve for x. 

x = 12

Therefore, each bracelet has 12 star-shaped stones. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

A: Let's think step by step. 

There is 0.16666666666666666 of a cup of oil in Scarlett's measuring cup. 

This means that there is 1/6 of a cup of oil in the measuring cup. 

If Scarlett adds 0.6666666666666666 of a cup more,

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many garments are bikinis. We know that 0.375 of the garments are bikinis, and we also know that the total number of garments is 1. So, we can set up the equation:

0.375 = x/1

We can solve this equation by multiplying both sides by 1. 

0.375 = 0.375x

1 = x

So, we know that there is 1 garment that is a bikini.

A: Let's think step by step. 

In one week, Mitch's family drank 0.5 of a carton of regular milk. 
This means that they drank half of a carton of milk. 
A carton of milk is equal to 1. 
Therefore, they drank 0.5 cartons of milk in all. 

In one week, Mitch's family drank 0.1 of a carton of soy milk. 
This means that they drank one tenth of a carton of soy milk. 
A carton of soy milk is equal to 1. 
Therefore, they drank 0.1 cartons

Q: A chef bought 0.14 kilograms of almonds and 0.38 kilograms of pecans. How many kilograms of nuts did the chef buy in all?
A: Let's think step by step. 

0.14 kg is equal to 1400 grams. 
0.38 kg is equal to 3800 grams. 

To find the total number of grams, we can add 1400 + 3800 to get 5200 grams. 

There are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, so we can divide 5200 by 1000 to get 5.2 kilograms. 

The chef bought 5.2 kilograms of nuts in all.

1) The numbers have to be even, and 
2) Their sum has to be 162. 

From 1), we know that the numbers have to be even. The smallest possible even number is 2. 

From 2), we know that the sum of the numbers has to be 162. 

2 + ? + ? = 162

2 + ? + ? = 162

We know that Fred has 110 blue marbles. 
We know that Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. 

This means that for every 1 blue marble that Tim has, Fred has 22 blue marbles. 

We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. 

110/22 = x/1 

We can cross multiply to solve for x. 

110 = 22x 

We can divide both sides by 22 to solve for x.

We need to find the total number of pears that were picked. In order to do this, we need to add the two numbers together.

45 + 11 = 56

Therefore, a total of 56 pears were picked. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 56.

Q: Uncle Dave bought 143 ice cream sandwiches. If he wants to give them to his 11 hungry nieces, how many can each niece get?
A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to divide 143 by 11. This will give us the number of sandwiches each niece will get if we divide them evenly. 

143 / 11 = 13

However, this is not an even division, so some nieces will get one more sandwich than others. 

To figure out how many nieces will get one more sandwich, we need to find the remainder of 143 when divided by 11. 

143 % 11 = 1

This means that 1 out of the 11 nieces will get 14 sandwiches. The other 10 nieces will get 13
