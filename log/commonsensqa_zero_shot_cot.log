Q: What is the thing that is agitated in your head when kissing? Answer Choices: (A) sexual stimulation (B) herpes (C) headache (D) catch cold (E) happiness
A: Let's think step by step. When you are kissing someone, you are physically close to them and may be exchanging saliva. This could lead to a transfer of the herpes virus if your partner has it. Additionally, kissing can lead to sexual arousal, which could cause a headache due to the increase in blood flow. It is also possible to catch a cold from kissing, as you are close to someone who may be sick. Finally, kissing can also lead to happiness due to the release of oxytocin, which is sometimes called the "cuddle hormone."

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to understand what the word "binoculars" means. Binoculars are two telescopes that are joined together and allow a person to see things that are far away. 

Now, we need to think about where a person might use binoculars. A person might use binoculars to see things that are far away and in the sky, or to see things that are far away and on the ground. 

So, the answer could be either (A) sky or (D) countryside.

Q: Killing people should not cause what emotion? Answer Choices: (A) vengeance (B) going to prison (C) joy (D) afraid (E) terrible
A: Let's think step by step. If someone kills another person, the natural reaction would be for the victim's friends or family to want revenge. However, killing another person is also a crime, so the perpetrator would likely go to prison. It's unlikely that the act of killing someone would bring joy. The perpetrator may be afraid of getting caught or facing retribution. Overall, the act of killing someone is likely to cause terrible emotions.

Q: From where does a snowflake form? Answer Choices: (A) cloud (B) snow storm (C) billow (D) air (E) snowstorm
A: Let's think step by step. A snowflake begins to form when a tiny dust or pollen particle (called an "ice nucleus") in the atmosphere sticks to a water droplet. This droplet is so cold that it is actually a tiny piece of ice. The water droplet freezes and becomes part of the ice nucleus.

As the ice nucleus falls through the atmosphere, it picks up more water droplets. These droplets freeze onto the ice nucleus, and the snowflake grows. The shape of the snowflake is determined by the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere as it falls. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A, cloud.

A toy store is a possibility, but chess sets are not typically considered toys. 

Michigan is not a likely option. 

The living room is a possibility, as chess sets are often used as decoration. 

The attic is a possibility, as chess sets are often stored in attics or other storage areas when they are not being used. 

The cupboard is a possibility, as chess sets are often stored in cupboards or other storage areas when they are not being used.

Q: When wildlife reproduce we often refer to what comes out as what? Answer Choices: (A) raise children (B) have children (C) photo copy (D) offspring (E) accidently got pregnant somehow
A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to identify the keyword in the question: "reproduce." This word tells us that we are dealing with a process that results in the creation of new life. 

Next, we need to think about what this process typically involves. In most cases, when an animal reproduces, it will create an offspring--a new individual that is genetically similar to the parent. 

Based on this information, we can eliminate choices (C) and (E) as they are not related to reproduction. This leaves us with choices (A), (B), and (D).

Q: Why would a woman kill a stranger she met in a dark alley? Answer Choices: (A) being raped (B) get rid of (C) they didn't know the passcode (D) get revenge (E) were evil
A: Let's think step by step. A woman is walking down a dark alley when she is suddenly attacked by a stranger. In order to protect herself, she kills him.

There are several possible reasons why she would do this. Perhaps she was afraid of being raped or killed, and so she fought back in self-defense. Alternatively, she may have wanted to get rid of the attacker for some other reason, such as revenge or because she simply didn't like him. It's also possible that she killed him because she believed he was evil and posed a threat to her or others.

Ultimately, we can't know for sure why the woman killed the man

Next, we need to think about where these nightclubs might be located. They are likely to be in areas where there are many people and where there is a lot of foot traffic. They are also likely to be in areas with a lot of other bars and clubs. 

Based on these criteria, we can eliminate choices (B), (C), and (D). 

Now we are left with choices (A) and (

Q: If you have a large satchel with you when you fly you'll be asked to store it where? Answer Choices: (A) airport (B) luggage compartment (C) with the pilot (D) room (E) clothing store
A: Let's think step by step. You have a large satchel and you're flying. The first thing that would happen is that you would go to the airport. 

At the airport, you would be asked to store your satchel in the luggage compartment. This is because the satchel is too large to bring on the plane and it would be a safety hazard.

Q: What is the opposite of an area of elevation? Answer Choices: (A) disgust (B) reduction (C) depression (D) demotion (E) diminishment
A: Let's think step by step. The word "opposite" is a clue that we are looking for an antonym, or a word with the opposite meaning. 

The word "elevation" can mean "the action of raising something to a higher position" or "a raised area of land." 

So, the antonym of "area of elevation" could be "area of reduction" (meaning, an area where something is lowered or decreased), "area of depression" (an area that is sunken or lowered), or "area of demotion" (an area where something is lowered in rank or status).

We can eliminate (B) stop working, because that's the opposite of what the question is asking. 

We can also eliminate (C) pay for, because that's not what we typically do when we're having fun. 

That leaves us with (A) spontaneous, (D) do like, and (E) do enjoy. 

The key word in the question is "fun." We can use that to help us figure out the answer. 

When we're doing something and having fun, we're usually doing something that we enjoy. That makes (E) do

However, upon further reflection, we realize that a crab is not a fish, so a fish market is not the best answer. A pet shop is also not the best answer, because a crab is not a pet.

A: Let's think step by step. People usually go into business to (1) make money and/or (2) achieve some other goal. So the answer choices that best reflect these motivations are "wealth" and "get rich." "Bankruptcy" could be a possibility if the business venture goes poorly, but it's not usually the goal. "Lose money" is the opposite of what people want to achieve, so it's not a good answer. "Home" might be a goal for some people, but it's not as common as the others, so it's not the best answer.

Q: In the building where James worked there was a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats.  Where might James work? Answer Choices: (A) theater (B) floors (C) concert hall (D) education (E) school
A: Let's think step by step. In the building where James worked, there was a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats. This means that the building where James worked had an auditorium, which is a room where people can watch a performance. This narrows down our answer choices to (A) theater, (C) concert hall, or (E) school.

We can further eliminate (C) concert hall because a concert hall is a place where people can listen to music, but it would not have a mezzanine to make more space for seats. This leaves us with (A) theater or (E

This likely means he wants it installed in his home, so he can be comfortable while he watches the game. The other choices don't make as much sense. Car air conditioners are usually not as strong as those installed in homes, and they wouldn't be able to cool down a whole house.

First, we know that Bob is in a room because he can see four walls. If he were outside, he would only be able to see two walls (the ground and the sky). 

Second, we know that the room is small because the only light source is a small bulb. If the room were big, there would be more light.

Third, we know that the room is dark because Bob can't see the door. If the room were light, he would be able to see the door.

Fourth, we know that the room is closed because Bob can't see the door. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

The first sentence says that the electricity went out and everyone was shrouded in darkness. This could happen in any number of places, so we can't make a definitive guess based on this information alone.

The second sentence says that they all remained in their seats. This suggests that they were in a place where there were seats, which narrows down our options somewhat.

Q: What might happen if someone is not losing weight? Answer Choices: (A) loose skin (B) beauty (C) miss universe (D) death (E) healthier
A: Let's think step by step. If someone is not losing weight, the first thing that might happen is that they will plateau. This means that their weight will stay the same even though they are still dieting and exercising. If they continue to not lose weight, they may become discouraged and give up. This could lead to weight gain, which can have many negative health consequences. So, while not losing weight may not be deadly, it could still have serious consequences.

A: Let's think step by step. If a person can't pay their bills, the first thing they should do is figure out why. Do they not have enough money coming in? Do they have too much going out? Once they know the problem, they can start to look for solutions. Maybe they need to get a better paying job, or maybe they need to cut back on their spending. Once they have a plan, they can start to take action and hopefully get their finances back on track.

A: Let's think step by step. The first thing we need to do is break down the question. It's asking us to find out which part of Joe's brain was working, given that he was able to memorize the list.

The list was probably a list of items, so Joe would have had to read it in order to memorize it. This means that the part of his brain responsible for reading was working.

The fact that Joe was able to memorize the list in spite of his apparent state proves that part of his brain was awake.

Q: If there is a place that is hot and arid, what could it be? Answer Choices: (A) bland (B) lifeless (C) sandy (D) neutral (E) freezing
A: Let's think step by step. A hot and arid place is a place that is both hot and dry. The first word, hot, narrows down our choices to (C) sandy and (A) bland. The second word, arid, means that there is little or no rainfall. This eliminates (A) bland, because it is not possible for a place to be both hot and have little rainfall. This leaves us with (C) sandy as the answer.

Q: If my husband never helps me doing housework, what might that lead to? Answer Choices: (A) boredom (B) arguments (C) headache (D) exhaustion (E) park
A: Let's think step by step. If your husband never helps you with housework, that likely means you have to do it all yourself. Doing housework by yourself can lead to boredom, because you're not doing anything else besides the same old tasks. It can also lead to exhaustion, because you're doing everything and not getting a break. Additionally, it can lead to arguments, because you may get frustrated with your husband for not helping and start to argue with him.

Q: What are our bodies doing after having food? Answer Choices: (A) falling down (B) digesting (C) gas (D) weight gain (E) not hungry
A: Let's think step by step. After we eat food, our body has to break down the food so that it can be used for energy. This process is called digestion. Digestion starts in the mouth with chewing and continues in the stomach and intestines.

After the food is broken down, it is absorbed into the bloodstream and carried to the cells of the body. The cells use the food for energy and growth. Any food that the cells don't need is stored in the body as fat.

So, the answer is B) digesting. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B) digesting.

First, we need to find an urban area. This narrows our choices down to (A) city and (B) downtown.

Then, we need to find a place to eat that is close to local nightlife. This means we can eliminate (C) mall and (D) shopping center, since they are not typically known for their nightlife.

A: Let's think step by step. People need food, water, and shelter. They might also need transportation, but that's not essential for survival. 

So based on that, we can eliminate choices (B), (C), and (D). 

People could live on the surface of the earth, but they would be exposed to the elements and it would be difficult to find food and water. So choice (E) is probably not the best answer.

A: Let's think step by step. A person sees a man with a suitcase full of money. They are probably not watching the man put the money in the suitcase in the first place, so (A) is not correct. It is also unlikely that they are watching a movie, so (B) is not correct. It is possible that they are watching the man on a subway, so (C) is not ruled out yet.

A: Let's think step by step. The first thing we need to do is identify the main verb in the sentence, which is "reduce." The subject of the sentence is "clients," so we can infer that the clients are reducing something.

Next, we need to think about what the clients are reducing. It seems that they are reducing the amount of surgery that they want. This is supported by the fact that the surgeon says that "girls no longer want to" do something.

So, we can infer that the correct answer is (A) reduction.

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to identify the subject of the sentence, which is "Sean." Then, we need to think about what the sentence is saying about Sean. The sentence says that Sean "loved to build houses." This means that Sean is good at building houses. However, the sentence also says that Sean is a "wreck." This means that Sean is not in a good state and is not able to do something.

A: Let's think step by step. If we want to show off silk, we need an item that is made of silk. That narrows it down to choices (C), (D), and (E).

If we want to show off the silk, the item should be something that highlights the silk's qualities, like its softness, shine, or drape. That means choice (E) is probably not the best option, since parachutes are designed to be functional rather than fashionable.

That leaves choices (C) and (D). Which is better? Well, silk is often used for expensive clothing, so choice (D) is a good

The most logical answer would be to "branch out." This means to try new things, explore new possibilities. This could mean trying new roles, or it could mean exploring other aspects of the entertainment industry. It could also mean simply taking a break from acting altogether.

Bugs generally fly or crawl. 
They can't fly very high, so an airplane is unlikely to get bugs on its windshield. 
A scooter is a ground vehicle, so it is also unlikely to get bugs on its windshield. 
A motorboat is a water vehicle, so it is also unlikely to get bugs on its windshield.

Q: What would you do to a crime scene before asking a question? Answer Choices: (A) express information (B) touch everything (C) think (D) give clue (E) analyse
A: Let's think step by step. The first thing you would want to do is secure the scene so that no one else can contaminate it. This means that you would want to put up police tape and make sure that only authorized personnel are allowed inside. Once the scene is secure, you would want to take a look around and see if there is anything that stands out to you. If there is, you would want to take a closer look at it and see if you can find any clues. Once you have done that, you would want to start asking questions.

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to understand the meaning of the word "fruit." According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, fruit can be defined as "the sweet and fleshy product of a tree or other plant that contains seed and can be eaten as food." 

Now that we know the definition of the word, we can better understand the meaning of the insult. If someone wanted to insult someone by calling them a fruit, they would be saying that the person is sweet and fleshy, and that they contain seeds. In other words, the person is like a piece of fruit.

A: Let's think step by step. The first thing we need to do is identify the main verb in the sentence, which is "listened." The subject of the sentence is "the audience," so we can infer that the audience was doing the listening. 

Now let's look at the second part of the sentence. It says that the orchestra was playing. This tells us that the audience was listening to the orchestra play. 

The final part of the sentence asks us where the audience was watching the performance. We can use the information in the sentence to infer that the audience was watching the performance in a concert hall.
