A: Let's think step by step. 

Shannon and her family eat toast every morning. 
They have a combined total of 6310 grams of jelly. 
If they have 4518 grams of blueberry jelly, how many grams of strawberry jelly do they have? 

We can solve this problem by using a proportion. 

We know that they have a combined total of 6310 grams of jelly. 
We also know that they have 4518 grams of blueberry jelly. 
We want to find out how many grams of strawberry jelly they have. 

We can set up a proportion using the information that we have

Q: Karin 's science class weighed plastic rings for an experiment . They found that the orange ring weighed 0.08333333333333333 ounce , the purple ring weighed 0.3333333333333333 ounce , and the white ring weighed 0.4166666666666667 ounce . What was the total weight of the plastic rings ?
A: Let's think step by step. 

The orange ring weighed 0.08333333333333333 ounce. 
The purple ring weighed 0.3333333333333333 ounce. 
The white ring weighed 0.4166666666666667 ounce. 

To find the total weight of the plastic rings, we need to add the weights of the orange ring, the purple ring, and the white ring. 

0.08333333333333333 + 0.3333333333333333 + 0.4166666666666667 = 0.8333333333333334

A: Let's think step by step. 

There are 3 types of materials - sand, dirt, and cement. 
For each type of material, we need a certain amount. 
We can express the amount of each type of material in terms of truck-loads. 

So, we need 0.16666666666666666 truck-loads of sand, 0.3333333333333333 truck-loads of dirt, and 0.16666666666666666 truck-loads of cement.

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to convert 2.8333333333333335 pounds to a whole number. This is because we can't have a fraction of a pepper. 2.8333333333333335 pounds is equal to 3 pounds. 

Next, we need to add 3 pounds (the number of green peppers) to 3 pounds (the number of red peppers). 

3 + 3 = 6

This gives us the following: 

0.16666666666666666 pound of peanuts x 16 ounces/pound = 2.6666666666666665 ounces of peanuts

0.16666666666666666 pound of chocolate chips x 16 ounces/pound = 2.6666666666666665 ounces of chocolate chips

Q: At the hardware store , 0.25 the nails are size 2d and 0.5 the nails are size 4d . What fraction of the nails are either size 2d or 4d ?
A: Let's think step by step. 

There are two types of nails, those that are size 2d, and those that are size 4d. 
We can represent this with the following fraction: 

There are a total of 1/4 nails that are size 2d, and 1/2 nails that are size 4d. 

To find the total number of nails that are either size 2d or 4d, we need to add these two fractions together. 

1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4

Therefore, 3/4 of the nails are either size 2d or 4d.

A: Let's think step by step.

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to find the difference in height between the two sandcastles. We can do this by subtracting the height of the smaller sandcastle from the height of the larger sandcastle. In this case, we would subtract 2.3333333333333335 from 3.6666666666666665. 

3.6666666666666665 - 2.3333333333333335 = 1.333333333333333

This means that Janet's sandcastle is 1.333333333333333 feet taller than her sister's sandcastle.

Q: Sara had 24 peaches and 37 pears at her fruit dish . She went to the orchard and picked peaches . There are now 61 peaches . how many did she pick ?
A: Let's think step by step. 

Sara had 24 peaches and 37 pears at her fruit dish.
She went to the orchard and picked peaches.

That means she picked some number of peaches, which we'll call "x." So we have:

x + 24 = 61

That's all the information we have, so we can solve for x:

x + 24 = 61
x = 37

That means she picked 37 peaches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 37.
