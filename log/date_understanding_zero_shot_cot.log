Today is 3/5, which means that one year ago, it was 3/5 - 1 year = 3/5 - 12 months = 3/5 - 365 days = 3/5 - 365.24 days. 
3/5 - 365.24 days = 3/5 - (365 + 24/100) days = 3/5 - (365 + 0.24) days = 3/5 - 365.24 days = 2/5 - 0.24 days = 2/5 - (0 + 24/100

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to figure out how many years, months, and days have passed since September 9, 1909. 

According to the Gregorian calendar, 4 years have passed since 1909. There have been 12 months in those 4 years, so 48 months have passed. There are 365 days in a year, so 365*4=1460 days have passed. 

Now, we need to figure out how many days have passed since September 9th. 

September has 30 days. 9 days have passed since September 9th, so 9+30=39 days have passed in September.

A: Let's think step by step. 

The current local time is 3:02 pm of 5/4/2004. 

3:02 pm of 5/4/2004 is 15:02 on 4/5/2004. 

1 month ago from 15:02 on 4/5/2004 would be 15:02 on 3/5/2004. 

Therefore, the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY would be 03/05/2004.

A: Let's think step by step. 

The date today is 02/23/2020. 

The date one week from today is 02/23/2020 + 7 days = 02/23/2020 + 1 week = 02/30/2020.

A: Let's think step by step. 

The concert was scheduled to be on 06/01/1943, which was a Wednesday. 
The concert was delayed by one day, so it was held on 06/02/1943, which was a Thursday.

Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 

That means that 176 days have passed since then. 

If we want to know what the date was one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from 176 days. 

176 days - 7 days = 169 days 

Now we need to convert 169 days into a date.
